## The best parts!!!
* Choose your Avenger and get into the universe of the Avengers! 
* Make some incredible choices!
* The choice you make leads you to your own end!
* Fight Thanos and his army with the Avengers!!!

## The fighting system
* First, you will choose your own Avenger with different hit points and feats!
* Then, have a fight with Thanos and do your best! 
* Last, we'll deal with the fight results and gives you the different ends!

### How the system works?
1. Make a `file` just for Avengers, inside it is the `class` dealing with the Avengers' `functions`.
2. Same as Thanos's `file`!
3. `combat.py` will be the `file` that holds the system. We do the caculations and the action choices there.
4. `main.py` organize the `files` then make everyting works!
